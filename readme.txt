Easy WP LaTeX provides a very easy way to display math and equations in your posts using LaTeX. Lets you customize colors and sizes of your equations.

== Description ==

*Easy WP LaTeX* provides a very easy way to display equations or mathematical formulas  (typed in as TeX or LaTeX code) in your posts. It lets you customize colors and sizes of your equations to match your blog theme.

Most LaTeX/equation plugins I have seen suffer from a few drawbacks.

1. They require installations of TeX or other packages on your server.
1. They are fairly inflexible in terms of colors of text and background.
1. Each time you switch your theme, you have to re-configure your color scheme.
1. They may not let you choose how to input LaTeX code. ([math]...[/math] or $$...$$) without editing the plugin code.

My plugin aims to be flexible, and easy to install (no geeky code editing etc.). It is now available in your own language using machine translation curtsey of Google and Microsoft.

= Pro Version =

This release is the freely distributed version of *Easy WP LaTeX*. It is fully functional. But the **[Pro Version](http://buy.thulasidas.com/easy-latex/ "Pro version of the Easy WP LaTeX plugin for only $2.95")** gives you more features and benefits. For instance, it gives you an option to cache the formula images so that your pages load faster. New features and bug fixes will first appear in the Pro version before being ported to this freely distributed edition. Also available in the Pro version is an option to align the formula image with respect to the text around it.

= Alternatives =
1. *Latex for WordPess* by zhiqiang, on which this plugin is based, has caching and JS based image generation. But it lacks intuitive color matching and theme-dependent settings.
2. *JetPack* also lets you insert LaTeX formulas, again color matching is not easy.

== Upgrade Notice ==

Compatibility with WordPress V3.9.

== Screenshots ==

1. How to set the options for *Easy WP LaTeX*.
2. *Easy WP LaTeX* in action - on my own blog.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the *Easy WP LaTeX* plugin (the whole easy-wp-latex-lite folder) to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the Setup -> Easy WP LaTeX and set options.
4. If instructed, set the file permission of the cache directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How come there is not a single frequently asked question? =

Two possible reasons.

1. *Easy WP LaTeX* is so simple and straight-forward that no question could be thought of.
1. More likely, the plugin is too new for any questions.
